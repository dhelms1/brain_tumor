# Brain Tumor

---

Project will focus on classifying brain tumors into 4 different categories (glioma, meningioma, none, and pituitary). Dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) and will be set up in AWS SageMaker to learn deployment with TensorFlow (as well as learning TensorFlow syntax). Image segmentation might be added (but no labels are available).

*README will be updated as project is worked on...*
